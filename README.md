This library provides an implementation of the _GCS_ heuristic for solving QUBO problems.
In addition to GCS, it includes implementations of Simulated Annealing and [_Local Quantum Annealing_](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.18.034016), along with interfaces to the [_TAMC_](
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2401.07184) heuristic and the [_Gurobi_](https://www.gurobi.com/) exact solver for comparison purposes.

While the core functionality is fully implemented, the repository remains under development. Future updates will focus on code documentation, usage examples, and tests.
